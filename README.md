# Content Management System with PHP

I have created a sample with php for cms. Those who wish may take it and continue to develop themselves. <br>
It is now at the basic level. <br>

### Setup
Create a database with the name you specified in config.php <br>
Create admins, contact, members, newsletter, partners and roles tables in this database. <br>

### Advice to those who want to clone and develop.
1- To make the web page completely dynamic.<br>
2- Adding theme<br>
3- Remove single page design.<br>

Don't forget to change config.php
